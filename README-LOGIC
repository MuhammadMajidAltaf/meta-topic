Some helpful tips on creating the logic (aka bitfile).

Extra GPIO pins (e.g. for buttons, LEDs or the OLED).

Start the "xps" tool and open an existing design. I strongly suggest
using ADI's reference designs:
http://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/xilinx/kc705/adv7511

The tool usually opens with the graphical zynq view. Click on the
I/O Periferals block to the left.

*hint* If you're using the zc702, de-active i2c0 and make sure pins
50 and 51 are left as GPIO. The i2c hardware is NOT being used by the
kernel, older kernels were hacked to patch that back.

Expand the "GPIO" tree at the bottom, and activate the "EMIO GPIO"
part. Set the dropdown to the number of extra GPIOs you want to use
(on the Zedboard, "11" is a good choice to get the buttons and OLED
to work.)

The pins will not go anywhere yet. Close the MIO config and
activate the "Ports" tab of the system assembly view.

Expand "processing_system_7_0" in the tree. Then expand the child
labelled "(IO_IF) GPIO". It probably says "Not connected to external
ports", we're about to change that. Click on that text and change it
to "Make ports external". You should see the "GPIO" child item change
into "External ports processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin"

The next black magic incantation we need is to route these GPIO lines
to the I/O pins in the actual package. This is done in the UCF file.
Doubleclick the UCF file in the project box. This opens the file for
editing. 

To map the OLED and buttons, add the following text:

NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[0]  LOC = P16  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "BTNC"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[7]  LOC = R16  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "BTND"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[8]  LOC = N15  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "BTNL"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[9]  LOC = R18  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "BTNR"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[10] LOC = T18  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "BTNU"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[4]  LOC = U10  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "OLED-DC"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[3]  LOC = U9   | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "OLED-RES"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[5]  LOC = AB12 | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "OLED-SCLK"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[6]  LOC = AA12 | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "OLED-SDIN"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[1]  LOC = U11  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "OLED-VBAT"
NET processing_system7_0_GPIO_pin[2]  LOC = U12  | IOSTANDARD="LVCMOS25";  # "OLED-VDD"

This will connect gpio54 (remember, 0..53 are the MIO pins for the CPU) to BTNC. And
so on. The OLED is set up as in the devicetree for the Zedboard here. You might
also want to route the LEDS as well.

Now build the whole thing by clicking on the Export icon, since we'll need to do
the FSBL too. This will take a loooong time, so get coffee now. Or you can start
building the software, because the Xilinx tools only use one or two cores.
