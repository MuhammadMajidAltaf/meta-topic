BSP for Xilinx Zynq dev boards. For instructions on building, see:

https://github.com/balister/meta-zynq/wiki/Getting-started

For the lazy, here's a quick script:

mkdir my-zynq
cd my-zynq

git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core oe-core
git clone git://github.com/openembedded/meta-oe.git meta-oe
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake bitbake
git clone http://github.com/topic-embedded-products/meta-topic.git meta-topic

meta-topic/scripts/init-oe.sh

cd build

# Edit local.conf to match your setup. In particular, check the paths to
# the Xilinx tools.
vi conf/local.conf

# The default machine is "topic-miami-7015", change it in the "profile"
# script or just export the MACHINE environment before builing.

# Then build your first image and relax a bit:
. ./profile
nice bitbake my-image

Note that "my-image" was designed to be used with DISTRO=tiny. It
expects to run with busybox-mdev instead of udev.

For the Miami boards, there is a miami-vice-image that can be run on the
miami board using only the "Miami Vice" debugging add-on. This image can
be loaded into RAM using JTAG and run from there, see README-JTAGBOOT
for more information on how to do that.

In order to properly use the zynq for anything useful, you will need to
build a bit image and FSBL using the Xilinx tools. README-LOGIC contains
some tips on that (mainly for myself because I keep forgetting these
tricks).

This started as a fork of Ballister's OE environment for Zynq boards.

This repository also contains support for Dyplo, see
http://www.topicembeddedproducts.com/products/dyplo/

In future, this OpenEmbedded overlay is to be split up into several
components, as to separate the board support package for Topic Miami
boards, the Dyplo framework and the tiny distro.

If you have questions or comments, I usually read the Xilinx Linux forum and
the ADI linux driver forum:
