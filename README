BSP for Xilinx Zynq dev boards. For instructions on building, see: 

https://github.com/balister/meta-zynq/wiki/Getting-started

In order to properly use the zynq for anything useful, you will need to
build a bit image and FSBL using the Xilinx tools. README-LOGIC contains
some tips on that (mainly for myself because I keep forgetting these
tricks).

This is a fork of Ballister's OE environment for Zynq boards. This repo
mainly serves to share ideas and code for the Zynq series. In this version
I have so far made the following additions:

- Faster booting by tweaking boot params.

- Build BOOT.bin using Xilinx tools (which you'll need to install for this)
  from within OE. u-boot will be built by OE, you'll need to create a FSBL
  and optionally a logic bit file and point OE variables to their location.

- Allow mixed booting, e.g. bootloader from QSPI, kernel and rootfs on SD.
  This is implemented by checking for an "autorun" script on the SD card.
  There's a recipe in the build that boots like described. You can have the
  script do anything that the u-boot shell supports.

- Offer kernels from Xilinx and ADI (for their framebuffer).

- Boot and run completely from QSPI flash, mounting a UBIFS root filesystem
  allowing read/write access.

If you have questions or comments, I usually read the Xilinx Linux forum and
the ADI linux driver forum:
