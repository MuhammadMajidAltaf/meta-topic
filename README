BSP for Xilinx Zynq dev boards. See: 

https://github.com/balister/meta-zynq/wiki/Getting-started

to get started.

Questions to philip@opensdr.com. No pormise I can answer them all. If this
becomes popular, I'll create a mailing list for it. I try and follow the
Xilinx forums, but I find forums painful to use.
